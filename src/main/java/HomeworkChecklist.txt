SHORT ANSWERS
    [ ] Comment below what the difference between TestNG and the main method is
        // ANSWER HERE: TestNG does not require main method to run a program. It uses 
        annotations to take care of the execution. Main method on the other hand is an
        entry point to execute a Java Program.
